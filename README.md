### RSS aggregator â€” Hexlet educational project
An RSS aggregator is a client program or web application that automatically collects news from sources that export to the RSS format, such as news headlines and blogs.

The application supports input validation and does not allow duplicates to be added. It allows you to add an unlimited number of RSS feeds, updates them itself and adds new entries to the general feed.
